\section{}
In the release method of the monitor, the \texttt{nonZero} condition is only
signalled once. If multiple threads were waiting, only one would have been 
awoken. To fix this, we can either \texttt{signalAll} or cascaded signalling
must be utilized.

\section{}
First, thread \texttt{P} is ran, we print "A" and start the \texttt{release} method.
We run the empty check on the condition, but before we increment permissions, we
switch to thread \texttt{Q} where we acquire. Since, we have not incremented 
permissions, it is still equal to zero, and we wait. Now, we switch back to 
\texttt{P}, where the thread will finish it's function block and increment
permissions. Since we are never signalled at the end of \texttt{P}, thread 
\texttt{Q} is stuck in the wait condition and "B" is never printed.
